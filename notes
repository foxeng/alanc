TODO:
- Checks:
  - OPT: For functions (i.e. not proc), check that they contain a return.
  - OPT: Bounds.
- Intermediate code.
- LLVM.

- Test:
  - Parser tests.
  - Semantic tests: go by the spec, create test suite.


OPT:
- Track source locations in AST.
- Better error messages: more uniform, more informative.


NOTES:
- We use package unicode in the lexer. This doesn't mean that we accept unicode since the input is
processed byte for byte (and the functions in 'unicode' when operating on single bytes practically
accept ASCII).
- The lexer and the parser must live in the same package because, if they lived in separate ones,
they would have to import each other, thus forming an import cycle (and these are forbidden in Go).
